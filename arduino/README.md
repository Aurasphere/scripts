#Arduino Sketches
This section contains some Arduino Sketches. Those are:
- bluetooth_led: a program that turns on and off a led based on a character sent via Bluetooth.
- bluetooth_infrared_remote: a program that emulates a TV remote by sending an infrared signal according to a Bluetooth input signal. This project has a dependency on [z3t0's Arduino IRremote](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote) repository.
